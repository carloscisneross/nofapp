# iOS Setup Guide - nofApp

## Overview
This guide covers the steps to set up and test the iOS version of nofApp with live Firebase and RevenueCat integrations.

## Prerequisites
- macOS with Xcode 15+ installed
- Flutter SDK 3.29.x
- iOS Simulator or physical iOS device
- RevenueCat iOS SDK key
- Firebase configuration files (already in repo)

## Setup Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd /path/to/nofapp
flutter pub get
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

### 2. Configure Xcode Project

Open the project in Xcode:
```bash
open ios/Runner.xcworkspace
```

**Important:** Always open `Runner.xcworkspace`, NOT `Runner.xcodeproj`

#### Add GoogleService-Info.plist to Xcode:
1. In Xcode, right-click on the `Runner` folder in the project navigator
2. Select "Add Files to Runner..."
3. Navigate to `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`
4. Check "Copy items if needed"
5. Ensure "Runner" target is checked
6. Click "Add"

#### Enable In-App Purchase Capability:
1. Select the Runner project in the navigator
2. Select the Runner target
3. Go to "Signing & Capabilities" tab
4. Click "+ Capability"
5. Add "In-App Purchase"

#### Verify Bundle Identifier:
1. In "General" tab, ensure Bundle Identifier is: `com.nofapp.app`
2. This must match your RevenueCat configuration

#### Configure iOS Version:
1. In "General" tab, set Deployment Target to: `iOS 13.0`

### 3. Configure App Icons

The app uses multiple icon variants for iOS:

**Asset Catalog Structure:**
- `AppIcon` - Main app icon
- `AppIcon-Dark` - Dark mode variant
- `AppIcon-Glass` - Glass/liquid effect variant
- `AppIcon-Tinted` - Monochrome tinted variant

To configure in Xcode:
1. Open `Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset`
2. Drag icon files from `assets/icons/ios/` to appropriate slots
3. Repeat for each icon variant

**Icon Requirements:**
- Light mode: `assets/icons/ios/ios light mode.png`
- Dark mode: `assets/icons/ios/ios dark mode.png`
- Glass: `assets/icons/ios/glass icon.png`
- Tinted: Uses monochrome glyph for dynamic tinting

### 4. Build and Run

#### Development Build (with RevenueCat):
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run --dart-define=RC_IOS_SDK_KEY=your_ios_sdk_key_here
```

#### Development Build (without RevenueCat - stub mode):
```bash
flutter run
```

#### Release Build:
```bash
flutter build ios --release --dart-define=RC_IOS_SDK_KEY=your_ios_sdk_key_here
```

## Troubleshooting

### Firebase Issues

**Problem:** "Firebase initialization failed"
**Solution:** 
- Verify `GoogleService-Info.plist` is added to Xcode project
- Check that Bundle ID matches: `com.nofapp.app`
- Clean build: `flutter clean && cd ios && pod install`

### RevenueCat Issues

**Problem:** "RevenueCat API key not provided"
**Solution:**
- Ensure you're passing SDK key: `--dart-define=RC_IOS_SDK_KEY=your_key`
- Verify key starts with `appl_` (Apple/iOS key)
- Check RevenueCat Dashboard for correct key

**Problem:** "No offerings available"
**Solution:**
- Verify products are configured in RevenueCat Dashboard
- Check product IDs match: `nofapp_premium_monthly`, `nofapp_premium_yearly`
- Ensure products are attached to entitlement: `premium`
- Wait a few minutes for RevenueCat cache to update

**Problem:** "Purchase failed"
**Solution:**
- Verify In-App Purchase capability is enabled
- Check sandbox tester is signed in
- Ensure products are in "Ready to Submit" status in App Store Connect
- Try different sandbox tester account

### Build Issues

**Problem:** "Pod install failed"
**Solution:**
```bash
cd ios
pod deintegrate
pod install --repo-update
```

**Problem:** "DT_TOOLCHAIN_DIR cannot be used to evaluate LIBRARY_SEARCH_PATHS"
**Solution:**
- Update CocoaPods: `sudo gem install cocoapods`
- Update pods: `cd ios && pod update`
- Clean build: `flutter clean`

**Problem:** "Module 'firebase_core' not found"
**Solution:**
```bash
flutter clean
rm -rf ios/Pods ios/Podfile.lock
cd ios && pod install
cd ..
flutter pub get
```

## Environment Variables

The app uses `--dart-define` for secure key management:

```bash
# iOS Development
flutter run --dart-define=RC_IOS_SDK_KEY=appl_xxxxx

# iOS Release Build
flutter build ios --release --dart-define=RC_IOS_SDK_KEY=appl_xxxxx

# For CI/CD
flutter build ipa \
  --dart-define=RC_IOS_SDK_KEY=appl_xxxxx \
  --export-options-plist=ios/ExportOptions.plist
```

## Next Steps

After iOS is working:
1. Generate release IPA
2. Upload to TestFlight
3. Invite beta testers
4. Collect feedback
5. Move to Android setup (after Play Console upload)

## Notes

- **Android:** Android setup is pending until an .apk is uploaded to Play Console
- **Stub Mode:** App runs without RevenueCat key but with limited premium features (mocked)
- **Firebase:** All Firebase operations are now live (Auth, Firestore)
- **Entitlement:** The premium entitlement name is `premium` (not customizable)
- **Product IDs:** Monthly=`nofapp_premium_monthly`, Yearly=`nofapp_premium_yearly`

## Support

For issues:
1. Check Firebase Console for auth/database errors
2. Check RevenueCat Dashboard for IAP errors
3. Review Xcode console logs for detailed error messages
4. Use Flutter DevTools for performance debugging
