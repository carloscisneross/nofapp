The trajectory outlines the complete, from-scratch development of a Flutter application named nofApp. The process began with an empty repository containing only asset files. The initial phase involved the AI engineer analyzing a detailed product brief, proposing a multi-phase implementation plan, and getting user approval.

Following approval, the engineer scaffolded the entire application structure, including data models, services (for Firebase, RevenueCat, etc.), Riverpod state management providers, navigation using go_router, and the full UI for all specified features like authentication, profile, feed, and guilds. This initial build used stubs for external services like Firebase and RevenueCat.

The subsequent phase, Phase 4, focused on production polishing. This involved addressing user feedback to refine the UI/UX to match design sketches precisely, improving code quality by fixing deprecated APIs, enhancing performance and accessibility, and preparing documentation (README, config files, QA notes).

The final messages confirm the completion of this polish phase. The app is now considered a feature-complete MVP, fully prepared for live service integration. The user has just provided the necessary Firebase configuration files and RevenueCat API keys, and the immediate next step is to wire these live services into the app and perform end-to-end testing as per the user's specific test plan.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a clean, modern, Material 3 Flutter application named nofApp. The app should be a full-featured social/gamified experience, including user onboarding, authentication (email/password, guest), and a profile system with avatar picking, daily check-in streaks, and unlockable medals.

Key features include a global feed for all users and a premium-gated Guilds system, where users can create, join, and manage communities. Monetization is handled through in-app purchases via RevenueCat, which gates access to premium avatars and the entire Guilds feature set.

The technical implementation must adhere to strict constraints: Flutter SDK 3.29.x, specific versions for Android Gradle Plugin (8.7.0) and Gradle (8.10.2), and a Kotlin JVM target of 17. The state management must use , navigation with , and the backend will rely on Firebase (Auth, Firestore). All development must use the assets (avatars, icons, medals) provided in the repository. The final app must have correctly configured launcher icons for both iOS (light, dark, glass, tinted) and Android (adaptive).

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Framework:** Flutter SDK 3.29.x with Material 3 design.
- **State Management:**  for centralized and reactive state.
- **Navigation:**  for a declarative, URL-based routing solution.
- **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS):** Firebase for Authentication and Firestore for the database.
- **In-App Purchases (IAP):**  (RevenueCat) for managing subscriptions and premium entitlements.
- **Build Tooling:** Specific versions of Android Gradle Plugin, Gradle, and NDK.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a feature-driven directory structure, separating concerns for scalability and maintenance. Core logic, models, and services are decoupled from the UI.



-   **/app/lib/main.dart**: The application's entry point. It initializes the  for Riverpod and sets up the main  with the router. It was updated to include an app lifecycle manager.
-   **/app/lib/core/providers.dart**: Central hub for all Riverpod providers. This file defines providers for authentication state, user profile data, premium status, feeds, and guilds, making state accessible throughout the app.
-   **/app/lib/data/services/premium_service.dart**: Encapsulates all logic related to RevenueCat. It handles initializing the SDK, fetching offerings, processing purchases, and checking for active premium entitlements. It was refactored to be production-ready, using keys from .
-   **/app/lib/data/services/streak_service.dart**: Contains the business logic for managing user check-ins and calculating streaks. Network guards and timeouts were added during the polish phase to make it more robust.
-   **/app/lib/features/**: This directory contains the UI for each distinct feature of the app (e.g., , , ). Each subdirectory has its own screens and widgets, such as  which is triggered by premium-gated actions.
-   **/app/android/app/build.gradle**: Key Android configuration file. It was created and verified to ensure it uses the required  (34),  (23), and  (27.0.12077973).
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Integrate the live Firebase configuration files (, , ).
- Wire the live RevenueCat SDK keys and product IDs into the application.
- Execute the end-to-end sandbox purchase test plan provided by the user to validate the full IAP flow.
- Add the Yearly subscription product once the user provides it.
- Generate a final APK build for upload to the Play Console.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed Phase 4, a comprehensive polish and preparation stage. The entire nofApp application is now feature-complete, with all UI screens, data models, services, and state management implemented according to the user's detailed specifications. The work included fixing deprecated APIs, improving UI/UX to match design sketches, enhancing accessibility and performance, and creating extensive project documentation (, , etc.).

Crucially, the app's integrations with Firebase and RevenueCat are currently implemented as stubs, allowing the app to run and be tested without live services. The user has just provided the live configuration files and API keys for both Firebase and RevenueCat. The current, immediate task is to transition the application from using these stubs to the live services, effectively turning on the real backend and payment systems for the first time. The final step of this transition will be to run the user's provided end-to-end test plan to validate the entire live purchase and entitlement flow in a sandbox environment.

<optional_next_step>
Integrate the live Firebase services by replacing the stubbed initialization in  with the real initialization using the newly provided .
