   - Ensure all required sizes are filled

**Verify:** All icon slots filled, no warnings

### 3. Build and Run (First Time)

#### A. Clean Build
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

#### B. Run with RevenueCat Key
```bash
flutter run --dart-define=RC_IOS_SDK_KEY=your_actual_ios_sdk_key_here
```

**Replace** `your_actual_ios_sdk_key_here` with the real iOS SDK key from RevenueCat Dashboard.

**Expected Console Output:**
```
Launching lib/main.dart on iPhone...
Running pod install...
Running Xcode build...
‚úì Built build/ios/Debug-iphonesimulator/Runner.app
